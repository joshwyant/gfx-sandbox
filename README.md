# gfx-sandbox
Sandbox for me to learn various graphics frameworks.

1. [Rasterizer (2008)](#1-rasterizer-2008): Soft 3D rasterizer
2. [GLWinFF](#2-glwinff): OpenGL fixed-function and WinAPI

## 1. Rasterizer (2008)
A software 3D graphics rasterizer from scratch. Converted to VS 2022 project. Runs on Windows.

Rendering code: [Rasterizer/MainForm.cs](Rasterizer/Rasterizer/MainForm.cs)

Math helpers: [Rasterizer/Math3D.cs](Rasterizer/Rasterizer/Math3D.cs)

Duplicated here from [github.com/joshwyant/rasterizer](https://github.com/joshwyant/rasterizer).

## 2. GLWinFF
Old-style OpenGL fixed-function pipeline using the Windows API.
